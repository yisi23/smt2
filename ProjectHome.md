(smt) is a simple mouse tracking system to follow and record the computer mouse activity on any Web page. Here you will find the basic information about (smt)<sup>2</sup>, the next step on remote/in-person mouse tracking technology.

This tool is focused on three topics:
  1. **Evaluate a website design**. Every website has objectives to achieve, so its design should support the intended goals.
  1. **Analyze and investigate mouse behavior trends**. There are certain mouse behaviors common across many users which are useful in many ways (e.g. increasing the effectiveness of an interface layout).
  1. **Serve as a multi-purpose toolkit**. You can expand the field of applications. For example: perform data mining tasks over a defined set of users, recruit visitors for a usability test, classify your audience, evaluate pointing performance and/or motor abilities... The possibilities are endless!

This project is a fully functional Open Source alternative to all those privative mouse tracking systems. You can study the code, adapt it, or even make derivative software. But **in any case you must give proper attribution to its author**.


This Google site is a centralized location for getting the latest (smt) source code and documentation, as well as resolving issues. However, you can [post comments](http://smt.speedzinemedia.com/comments.php) at [(smt) website](http://smt.speedzinemedia.com) and/or request new features.
